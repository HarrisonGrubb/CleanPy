# CleanPy
This package cleans a dataset and returns summary statistics as well as number, proportion and location of NA values for string and number column inputs. Data cleaning made easy!

## Overview
There is a dire need for a good data cleaning package, and we are trying to develop our version of a good data cleaning package that will help users clean their data in a meaningful way. Data cleaning is usually the first step in any data science problem, and if you donâ€™t clean your data well, it might be really difficult to proceed further. So our motivation for coming up with this idea was to address this very issue of messy data.

CleanPy is especially developed to create a streamlined process to give you an easy to read summary statistics table about your data. CleanPy is able to easily locate all the missing data for you and allow you to locate where exactly it occurs. Not only are you able to locate missing data, you can also define how you would like to deal with your missing data.
